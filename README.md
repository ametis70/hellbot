# hellbot
hellbot is a [HELLDIVERSâ„¢](https://www.arrowheadgamestudios.com/aboutarrowhead/games/helldivers/) [Discord](https://discord.com/) bot

> Scientists Super Earth has developed a new stratagem. The BOT-21 'Hellbot' will broadcast interdimensional messages to gather all the Helldivers willing to participate in the Galactic Campaign.

## What does this bot do

- Send alerts when a capital city defend event starts/ends
- Send alerts when an attack on a faction homeworld starts/end 
- Give information about ongoing events when requested
- Give information about weapons/stratagems when requested

## How to add this bot to X server?

This bot does not have a public instance (yet?), so the only way to add it to a server is through self-hosting. Roughly, these are the steps to do so:

1. Create an app in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)  
2. Enable the bot for that app and save the bot token
3. Use the OAuth2 URL generator to create an authorization link with `bot` and `application.commands` permissions
4. Use the generated url to add the app to your server 
5. [Copy the ID for the channel](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID-) where hellbot will send attack/defend event alerts
6. Run the bot

## How to run the bot

Once you added the bot to your server, you can use [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/) to run it:

```sh
docker run -e\
  -e TOKEN=<Replace with bot token>\
  -e CHANNEL_ID=<Replace with channel ID>\
  ghcr.io/ametis70/hellbot:latest
```

The image is built for `linux/amd64`, `linux/arm/v7` and `linux/arm64`

### With Docker Compose

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file with the following content:

```yml
version: "2" 
services: 
  hellbot: 
    container_name: hellbot 
    image: ghcr.io/ametis70/hellbot:latest 
    environment: 
      - TOKEN=${TOKEN} 
      - CHANNEL_ID=${CHANNEL_ID} 
    restart: unless-stopped
```

and a `.env` file in the same directory:

```sh
TOKEN=<TOKEN>
CHANNEL_ID=<Replace with channel ID>
```

Then run with:

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```
